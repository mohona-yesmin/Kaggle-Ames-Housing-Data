# Project 2 - Ames Housing Price Prediction and Kaggle Challenge

## Problem Statement and Introduction

The housing market, a cornerstone of both individual lives and the broader economy, presents a complex landscape where accurate price predictions are of paramount importance. The Kaggle "Ames Housing Data" project offers an exciting opportunity to address this challenge comprehensively.

Determining the optimal selling price of a house is a multifaceted task, influenced by a multitude of variables. By harnessing the power of extensive data, our aim is to construct a robust linear regression model that excels in identifying the pivotal factors driving home valuations and producing precise predictions regarding housing prices in Ames, Iowa.

Specifically, our problem revolves around the question: **How can we effectively employ a linear regression model to enhance the accuracy of house sale price predictions?** The knowledge gained from this endeavor can prove invaluable for property owners seeking to maximize their home's market value and achieve a competitive edge in the real estate market.

The dataset contains a total of 2930 housing observations, and a large number of explanatory variables (23 nominal, 23 ordinal, 14 discrete, and 20 continuous) that includes critical attributes like square footage, Home functionality rating, kitchen quality and more. Within this dataset, these variables range from the objective and quantitative, such as the year built or the number of fireplaces, to the somewhat more subjective and qualitative, including evaluations of heating quality and exterior quality.

Our approach encompasses a holistic strategy that integrates feature engineering, feature selection, and regularization techniques. In this project, we have set two primary objectives: **to create a high-performing model and to ensure its reliability when dealing with new data**. We strive to consistently produce accurate predictions when confronted with previously unseen datasets, minimizing variations in predictive accuracy. Ultimately, we will assess the model's performance using the root mean squared error (RMSE) as a metric to measure the dissimilarity between the model's predictions and the actual observed values.
